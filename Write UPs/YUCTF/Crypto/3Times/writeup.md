I have first text ```woemk{F0b'F_R0x3_4k4br}``` its the flag and its viginere cipher 
first you need to try with flag format yuctf to know that is the beginneng of the key

then you go to try it on the second text because they shared in one thing ```rlaaftrqgjsngyhfhnvhdnjc```  first try yuctf then word 'tryha' is appeared in the output

replace the yuctf with 'tryharder' a well known word then 'yuctfcomp' is appeared in the output

take it and go to the third text ```rbkgpuamgeikrmqvkdamknjc``` and use yuctfcomp as a key 'thinksmar' is appeared as an output

and its a well known word "thinksmarter" use it as a key insted of yuctfcomp then in the output there will be 'yuctfcomplety'  appeared

take "yuctfcomplety" and go back to the first text ```woemk{F0b'F_R0x3_4k4br}``` use it as the text and boom its solved
