Name: SideChannel

In this write up I'll explain the methology and techniques I used it to solve this challenge.

We have executable pin_checker, it wants us to enter an 8-digit number for it.

When go back to the hints he told us to search about timing-based side-channel attacks 

Ok I will put a simple explanation and sources that helped me know what this attack are.

Timing-based attack, this attack depends on time analysis (The attacker must analize the time taken to execute.) 

and know after we know what the type of programs we deal with we need to try to exploit the pin_checker, let's find out how to perform this type of attacks
with using ```bash 
bash $ time key word 
```
