This challenge can be solved using <a href='https://www.kali.org/tools/sleuthkit'> Sleuthkit </a> 
but I solve it using FTK imager 

first I try to mount the disk image in FTK imager
then I searched for the flag in partition 1 and 2 but I found nothing.
in partition 3 I serched in home directory for any user but there is nothing to search for. 
But there is another root directory in first root dir open it and found my_folder when open it I found the flag.
