### Hints: 1-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption , 2-The search endpoint is only helpful for telling you if you are admin or not, you won't be able to guess the flag name

lets try to inspect the page and see the cookies.

I got this:

When I came back to the description of the challenge I noticed that the letters C, B, and C were uppercase
and this indicates to CBC encryption mode.

And we can do byte flipping attack on this mode. Check this out https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/cbc-byte-flipping-attack-101-approach/

Now we know that we must to brute force to get the right byte that have the admin's value (usually have 0 or one). To do that I use the function byte flip from <a href="https://github.com/HHousen/PicoCTF-2021/blob/master/Web%20Exploitation/More%20Cookies/script.py">this</a> write up to write my own script.
After we know the CBC byte flipping and wrote the script to brute force on the value we must to try the cookies.

Because I can't to do that manually I wrote this <a href="https://github.com/endline01/endline01/blob/main/Write%20UPs/picoCTF/Web%20exploitation/More%20cookies/MoreCookie.py"> script</a> to request the page and try cookies value.
